# sort-visualizer
This project visualizes the sorting of colors using various sorting algorithms. The workloads are also multithreaded so you can see the algorithm working in multiple lines (Multi-Algorithm Searching visualizes the differences pretty nicely). So far the algorithms implemented are Insertion, Selection, Bubble, and Merge Sorts. (Multi Algorithm Sorting uses the algorithms in this order: Bubble, Insertion, Merge, Selection)

## Setting Up
You must have a python environment with [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/) and the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) modules.

This install line should do the trick: ```pip install pygame numpy```

After that you can just run the main.py file and get started

## Controls
Randomize the colors - F5

Start Algorithm - Return or Enter

Change Algorithm - Left/Right Arrow Keys

Change Increment Size - Up/Down Arrow Keys

Toggle step timer (Fast Step): s

## Problems
* The algorithm times are relatively inaccurate. Selection sort is blazingly fast (Probably because it doesn't require copying as much data) while the other sorts seem slow in comparison. I need to find a way to accurately represent each algorithm's strengths

## Future Goals
* Add Play/Pausing (Probably not going to happen atm b/c requires complete rewrite)
* More Algorithms

## Built With

* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - IDE used
* [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/) - Visuals
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - Grid System
